## Music reviewer
I'm currently (in 2021) listening through ["The Sound of Everything"](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/69fEt9DN5r4JQATi52sRtq), Spotify's playlist of a song from every genre in their catalogue. There are over 5,500 tracks, and I'm about 1,000 from the end. My goal is to finish the whole playlist in 1 year.


For a few years as a PhD student [I wrote music reviews](http://thesightsandsounds.com/author/burnsr77/) of experimental, minimalist, ambient, and generally "weird" electronic tunes over at [The Sights and Sounds](http://thesightsandsounds.com/). I enjoyed writing there for a number of reasons, including the fact that it forced me to stay current on the scene, and it was a productive non-academic outlet of creative expression.

Check out what I'm listening to here: [Last.fm](http://www.last.fm/user/east_west). Generally, while I listen to a lot of different genres, I'm most into weird, challenging electronic music: drone, harsh noise, free jazz, and quiet ambient, for example. But I'm also likely to be playing acoustic indie, dub reggae, shoegaze, goth rock, and 90s college indie, and who doesn't have a soft spot for Lana del Rey?

## Ultra-marathon runner

I'm an ultra-marathon runner. I can't wait to have time to run more, but to date I've run a 50km (30 miles) and a 50 mile race. Came in 3rd for my first marathon, 6th at the 50k, and 157th (out of 400) at the 50-mile. I don't get out as much as I would like, but running long distances forms a large part of my identity at the moment. I volunteer at races, often run further than 20 miles in a workout, and am even a regular reader of UltraRunning Magazine! I am usually confronted with blank stares when I confess to people that I really enjoy watching ultra videos on YouTube.

While teaching at Temple University, my goal was to run every street in my neighborhood, South Philadelphia. Here's how I did:
<div id='map' style='height:800px; width:1200px'></div>
<script>
		var map = L.map('map',{center:[39.92149,-75.1625],zoom:14});

		L.tileLayer('http://{s}.tile.osm.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png', {
			attribution: '&copy; <a href="http://osm.org/copyright">OpenStreetMap</a> contributors'
		}).addTo(map);


		L.geoJson(runkeeper, {style: myStyle, onEachFeature: onEachFeature}).addTo(map);
</script>

## Tea

Favorites: Silver Needle, An Ji Bai Cha, Cold Summit Tung Ting, Cui Feng High Mountain, 2011 Huang Pian, Bi Luo Chun, Yunnan Gold.

White tea in general is probably my favorite tea to drink, but usually only the non-flavored types. White peony is a good example of a well-rounded white tea that has delicate, subtle floral flavors.
