I am a doctoral student in geography at the University of Washington and a research assistant with the Commons Lab at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. I’m broadly interested in the social and political implications of new mapping and spatial data production technologies. More specifically, my work seeks to draw connections between the ‘geoweb’, disaster management through crisis mapping, and inequality. The question that most motivates me is how Web 2.0 and geoweb forms of mapping and spatial data production influence social, economic, and political inequality, and what that inequality looks like.

I am also affiliated with UW’s Simpson Center through its Certificate in Public Scholarship program. Public scholarship, for me, means that I conduct research that is both intellectually and politically active. I incorporate one public through my efforts to communicate my scholarship widely, and another by working with the institutions that set public policies. One of my long-term academic goals is to do work that will improve the daily living conditions of people living in the global South, especially when impacted by disasters and subsequently crisis mapping. The certificate program is one step along this path.

Before coming to UW, I earned a M.S. in Geography at San Diego State University (2009). There, I worked with André Skupin to visualize people’s perceptions of San Diego neighborhoods. I created 5 Self-organizing Maps (SOM) to explore the relationship between people’s personal characteristics, visual representations of place, and the ways they describe those neighborhoods. Going even further back, in 2006 I graduated Magna Cum Laude from Eastern Kentucky University with a B.A. in Geography. My senior thesis, which I wrote under the guidance of David Zurick, explored the ways the cultural significance of bookstores in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, is changing in response to increasing globalization.

But most importantly, I am more than my academic interests. I have traveled to over a dozen countries and most of the 50 states. I am fanatic about: 1)music, 2)Belgian & IPA beer, 3)reading, 4)backpacking, 5)tea, 6)technology, and 7)my wife (yes, really). I would like to climb Mt. Kilimanjaro before the permanent snow melts. If I could go back in history to meet someone, I wouldn’t go far - probably mid-1920s and meet ee Cummings.
