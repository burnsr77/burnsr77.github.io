[fraser – the redistribution-recognition dilemma][1]

 [1]: http://students.washington.edu/rlburns/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/fraser-the-redistribution-recognition-dilemma.pdf

A wonderfully-written piece that examines the flip-side of the social justice we normally discuss. Social justice, for Fraser, depends not solely on the redistribution of resources, but also on recognition in terms set by those represented. Taking this a step further, Fraser would argue that contemporary inequality is not just in terms of income and wealth, although these are very, very important; inequality is also (re)produced through representations of the poor, the marginalized, and so on.
